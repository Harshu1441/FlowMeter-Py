# Real-Time CICFlowMeter (97-Feature) Flow Extractor

A full-featured real-time flow extractor that replicates and extends [CICFlowMeter], written in Python.

This tool extracts **97 detailed flow features** (transport + application layer) from live network traffic and exports them **directly to CSV**, ready for ML pipelines, security monitoring, and network analysis.

---

## âœ… Key Features

- **97 total flow features** (packet stats, IATs, flags, application-layer)
- **Supports both PyShark (Wireshark)** and **Scapy** for packet capture
- Extracts real-time flows from live traffic
- **Auto-creates and writes to `output/live_flow_features.csv`**
- Parses HTTP, TLS, and DNS layers
- Handles subflows, bulk metrics, active/idle periods
- Configurable flow timeout, subflow window, bulk interval, etc.
